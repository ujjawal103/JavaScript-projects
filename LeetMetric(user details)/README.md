# LeetMatric
<h1>Overview</h1> <br>
<p>LeetMatric is a JavaScript project that fetches basic details of a LeetCode user, such as the number of questions solved (categorized as Easy, Medium, and Hard), the user's acceptance rate, and ranking. The fetched data is visually represented using pie charts to provide a clear and concise overview of the user's performance. The project uses a random GitHub API to retrieve user data from LeetCode.</p>
